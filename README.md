# JavaTerminalGames
a terminal based java app that plays some games in the terminal

To run simply clone this repo and then run:
java -jar ./arcade.jar

A make file is also provided although it might not work perfectly on all OS.
It worked on on CentOS but not Ubuntu so we will need to fix that at some point
